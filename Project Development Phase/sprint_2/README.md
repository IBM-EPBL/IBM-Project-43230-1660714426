#About sprint 2 :

we succesfully developed a program which can detect hand gestures

It is very fast compared to other models

it is capable of detecting all the finger gestures

#Installing required libraries

python libraries required are opencv, cvzone, mediapipe

pip install opencv

pip install cvzone

pip install mediapipe

#important note:

the program requires 7 radiology images and 1 background image. in this program, we had given the path of the image in our system.

While you are running the code, please download the dataset and modify the path of the images in the program to the path where you have downloaded the dataset

The first seven radiology images are in the radiology_images folder

And the background image is in the background_images folder
